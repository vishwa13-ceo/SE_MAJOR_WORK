# SE_MAJOR_WORK: Stack-Like Data Structure in Java

This repository contains the implementation of a custom stack-like data structure called `RsaRepository`, along with test cases to demonstrate its functionality. The project is developed as part of a software engineering course to explore **Model-Based Testing** concepts.

---

## Features
- **Customizable Capacity**: Define the maximum size of the stack during initialization.
- **Basic Stack Operations**:
  - `store(int value)` (Push): Adds an element to the stack.
  - `retrieve()` (Pop): Removes and retrieves the top element of the stack.
  - `display()`: Returns the current contents of the stack.
- **Test Suite**: Automated test cases validate various stack states and operations.
